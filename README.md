## Analysis
The BikeStore is performed using SQL queru to get table to be used for visualization , so at the beggining to get the dataset you to options 1) Make the dataset from scratch if u want to optimize your self in SQL [Dataset](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database/) here you will find how to create it 2) Run the scripts to run the query [Create](https://github.com/AbdallahOdeh2/Bike_Stores/blob/a7d73fd8608c8856db8e4e08fcaf0bd869f69987/BikeStores%20create%20objects.sql) then insert the values to tables [Insert](https://github.com/AbdallahOdeh2/Bike_Stores/blob/a7d73fd8608c8856db8e4e08fcaf0bd869f69987/BikeStores%20load%20data.sql) , after that you have the ddecision of create your own query to get the data or use mine [SQL_QUERY](https://github.com/AbdallahOdeh2/Bike_Stores/blob/a7d73fd8608c8856db8e4e08fcaf0bd869f69987/SQLQuery4.sql) , For data visualization it's yur choice to make it in `Tableau` or `Excel` , I have used both [Excel_Viz](https://github.com/AbdallahOdeh2/Bike_Stores/blob/a7d73fd8608c8856db8e4e08fcaf0bd869f69987/BikeStores.xlsx) , [Tableau_Viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdallah4094/viz/BikeStoreDashboard_17054932184310/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
